- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheLagginator.  I usually go by "Lagginator", but that was taken.  Idk whether I somehow created an account with some other email or whether its cyber-shananigans
- 👀 I’m interested in ... figuring out what is happening to the internet, what is going on with all the wireless neural-inteface stuff, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how incompetent the world's foremost experts are, especially in the field of military intelligence and national security... many turn out to be terrorists unwilling to uphold their national laws and willing to attack civilians and to destroy their own infrastructure based on rumors or lies.  To be clear: I have been technically abused via secret technology my entire life, and it is only through the goodwill and good favor of some of the secret people using me that I am even alive and in anything close to good health.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... cyberwarfare, cybersecurity
- 📫 How to reach me ... please send me physical mail in a discrete envelope to let me know who is safe to contact or what technologies or factions are at play in Cyber Wars. I use X (formerly Twitter) and discord (both @Lagginator).
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I am part of an Ancient Meme-Engine of secret societies, and they might have made references to me in "Payday 2".  I still don't know what anyone's plans are, what they expect to gain from using me without paying me, or who controls Illinois.
